## summarizing your understanding of relational databases and SQL. 
    A relational database is a type of thing that holds data in tables. Each table has columns and rows, where the columns hold the different kinds of information and the rows hold specific records. You can link the tables together using keys, which helps you find related data.

    SQL is like a language that people use to talk to relational databases. You can use SQL to do things like making, changing, and deleting tables, as well as putting in, updating, and getting information from them. With SQL, you can also do other things like sorting and filtering data, and making calculations. SQL is really important if you work with data.
